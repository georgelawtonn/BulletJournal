SOLID Principles: We have adhered to the SOLID principles throughout the development of this app, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase.

Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility, with separate classes for popup windows, controllers, views, formatting, and data persistence.
Open-Closed Principle: The use of abstract classes allows for easy modification and extension without modifying existing functionality.
Liskov Substitution Principle: Subclasses adhere to the contracts defined by their superclasses, ensuring interchangeability without breaking the program.
Interface Segregation Principle: Subclasses are not forced to inherit unnecessary methods, maintaining a focused and cohesive interface.
Dependency Inversion Principle: Higher-level classes do not depend on lower-level classes, and abstractions do not depend on details, promoting flexibility and modularity.
